    cd GenieBox
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**

### Configuration - API Keys (Important!)

This project requires API keys from Google Gemini and WeatherAPI.com to function correctly. **These keys are NOT included in the repository for security reasons.**

You need to provide them using Flutter's `--dart-define` build arguments:

1.  **Google Gemini API:**
    *   Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **WeatherAPI.com:**
    *   Sign up and get your API key from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

<!-- **Store these keys securely.** Do *not* commit them directly into your code. -->

### Usage

To run the app, use the `flutter run` command and provide the API keys via `--dart-define`:

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY \
  --dart-define=WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_WEATHERAPI_KEY
```
